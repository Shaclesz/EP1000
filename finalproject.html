<h1>Useless Box</h1>

    <p>This is a preliminary sketch of my useless box project.</p>

<h1>The Project Design</h1>
<p>I first saw this useless box toy in an online video and it got me interested.<br>
   The useless box in the video I saw had many switches and only 1 arm to push the switches off.<br>
   When the switches got pushed to on position, the arm will come out and push the switch off.<br>
</p>
<p>There is alot of people online who also made their own useless box so I also wanted to<br>
make a simple one of my own.</p>

    <h1>Code for the Arduino</h1>
    <p>#include <Servo.h>

        const int  buttonPin = 2;
        int buttonState = 0;
        
        Servo myservo;
        int pos;
        long timeDelay;
        
        void setup()
        {
        pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
        myservo.attach(9);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
        }
        
        void loop() {
        buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);  // Read the button position
          if (buttonState == HIGH) {
             for(pos = myservo.read(); pos <=90; pos += 1)  // goes from 10 degrees to 90 degrees in 1 step
             {                                   
               myservo.write(pos);  // tell servo to go to position in variable 'ONpos'
               timeDelay = random(15, 30);
               delay(15);  // randomize wait time for the servo to reach the position
             }
        }
        else {
             timeDelay = random(1, 4);
             for(pos = myservo.read(); pos >=10; pos -= timeDelay)  // goes from 90 degrees to 10 degrees in 1 step 
             {                           
               myservo.write(pos);  // tell servo to go to position in variable 'OFFpos'                
               delay(15);  // randomize wait time for the servo to reach the position
             }
          }
        }</p>

    <h1>Completion, Problems met</h1>
    <p>I was able to complete the useless box but there are afew problems I encountered throughout<br>
    the process. One of which is that when I plugged in the 9V battery, the arduino board will not work<br>
as I programmed it.</p>
<p>Another problem I encountered was that the servo motor was too weak to push the switch back to the<br>
off position.</p>
<p>For this 2 main problems, I could not find a solution to them.</p>
<p>There was also other smaller problems that I managed to solved as well. For example, I wanted to<br>
Place the motor at the bottom of the box at first but soon realised that it will thus block the arm<br>
from rotating and the arm will not reach the switch as well. I then used some popsicle sticks to<br>
raise the motor higher so the arm could reach the swtich.</p>
